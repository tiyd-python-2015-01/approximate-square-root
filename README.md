Submitted program should satisfy both Normal, Hard and Extra Hard Mode objectives

# Approximate a square root

## Description

Write a program that asks the user for a positive number and then outputs the
approximated square root of the number. Use Newton's method to find the square
root, with epsilon = 0.01.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* How variables work
* How `while` works
* The concept of successive approximation

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Write a Python script
* Ask for input
* Print output

## Details

### Deliverables

* A GitHub repo called approximate-square-root containing at least:
  * This `README.md` file
  * a file called `square_root.py`

### Requirements  

Here is an example of the program running correctly:

```
$ python square_root.py
Enter a positive number: 4
The square root of 4 is 2.0.

$ python square_root.py
Enter a positive number: 20
The square root of 20 is 4.472137791286727.


Your program will be tested with the script `test.sh`. To run this script, run
`brew install roundup` first.

## Normal Mode

Newton's method of successive approximations says that whenever we have a guess
`y` for the value of the square root of a number `x`, we can get a better guess
(one closer to the actual square root) by averaging `y` with `x/y`. If we do
this over and over, we should be able to get a very accurate guess.

You have to write a script that asks the user for a positive number and then
compute the square root with a maximum error of 0.01. You then print out your
answer to the user.

## Hard Mode

In each iteration of your loop, print out the current number of iterations and
the current guess.

Examine the input into your program and give an appropriate error message if
a non-number or negative number is given.

## Extra Hard Mode

Look up [complex numbers in Python][]. Allow negative numbers as input into
your program.
